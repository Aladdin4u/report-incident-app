## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js Express, ejs, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB

## Optimizations

One of the first thing I would optimize is the UX of how someone report with the details with what has occured in real-time. I would also work on the navigation website for easy usage. Lastly I would make it so that a reporter can upload audio file.

## Lessons Learned:

Utilized callback functions in the server to try and build a modular and scalable backend. Through this I learned , how to effectively simplify backend routes into independent functions
